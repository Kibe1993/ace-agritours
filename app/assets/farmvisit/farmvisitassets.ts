  <h2>üêÑ Introduction to Dairy Cows</h2>
  <p>Dairy cows are a cornerstone of agricultural economies and daily nutrition for millions of people around the world. These remarkable animals are bred and cared for specifically for their milk production...</p>

  <h3>üß¨ Breeds and Characteristics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Holstein-Friesian:</strong> The most common breed worldwide, known for high milk yield.</li>
    <li><strong>Jersey:</strong> Smaller in size but produces rich, high-fat milk.</li>
    <li><strong>Guernsey, Brown Swiss, and Ayrshire:</strong> Popular for balance of quantity and quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üçΩ Feeding and Nutrition</h3>
  <p>Proper nutrition is essential for optimal milk production. Dairy cows are typically fed a combination of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fresh pasture (especially in rotational grazing systems)</li>
    <li>Silage (fermented grasses or maize)</li>
    <li>Grains and concentrates rich in energy and protein</li>
    <li>Mineral supplements to ensure balanced calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin intake</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>ü•õ Milking Process</h3>
  <p>Modern dairy farms often use automated milking machines to reduce stress...</p>

  <h3>ü©∫ Health and Welfare</h3>
  <p>Animal welfare is a critical component of dairy farming. Cows receive regular veterinary checkups...</p>

  <h3>üåç Role in Sustainable Farming</h3>
  <p>Dairy cows also contribute to sustainability when managed correctly...</p>
